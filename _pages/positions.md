I currently have an open PhD position. This position investigates small structures on networks that may reveal important network information. In particular, the position is on networks that are rich in structure, 
where vertices have many features, such as clicks, likes and locations. These features position the vertices in a geometric space, where each coordinate represents one feature. In many applications, the
number of features is immense, creating a high-dimensional geometry. This position investigates important properties of such high-dimensional networks: What do these networks look like? And can we compress them?  For more information, please contact me. 

I also have several topics available for master students, ranging from epidemics on networks, to modeling social networks to optimal drone deployment. 
So if you are interested in a master graduation project about the appications and mathematics behind large-scale networks, feel free to contact me for more information.
